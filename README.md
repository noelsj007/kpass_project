KPass

KSRTC and IRCTC pass, Online Application Portal
 
About this project: Kpass is an online platform for students to apply for the “Kerala state RTC” student pass and for people seeking to get the IRCTC season pass. This online platform consists of all the procedures to apply for these. It uses artificial intelligence in the backend to review the applications and calculate the bus ticket fair. It will be completely automated software where the AI take care of the revision of the application and automatic generation of the pass card. We’ve planned to develop it as a web Admin panel and a mobile app for users to apply which will make the usage easier, also we’ve planned to develop the app as a PWA(progressive web app) web app so the user can make use of both the website and the mobile  App. 
 
There is no existing system to apply for both these passes. It could make the application process effortless for everyone. Also, the system will provide an online virtual card which can prevent loss or damage to the card also we can provide the option to download and print the card. Also for the virtual card, we can provide the option to manage the travel log, like the conductor or TTR can mark the use of the card virtually in the app. 

Also In the User app, we’ll provide the details of the Bus and train which are providing service on their route, the route is taken from the application. They can see all the available Trains and Buses on the routes and the estimated time of arrival at the boarding stop. If needed we can also add real-time tracking of them.
